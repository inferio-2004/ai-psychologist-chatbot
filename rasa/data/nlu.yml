    to make it stop.

    - I am very self conscious about my body

    - On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look
    like I had bigger boobs. I did that the whole school year and my parents never

    - How come no man sparks my interest?

    - I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make
    me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything

    my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?

    get nearly as bad as he does, but I yell almost constantly and I can''t seem to
    just stop. I have two young babies that have to hear this, and I don''t want my

    and them.
